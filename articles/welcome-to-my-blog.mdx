## ðŸ‘‹ Hey There!

Hey, thanks for checking out my blog. My name is Ryan Schachte and I created this blog to help teach others things that I've learned in my journey through engineering.
Feel free to browse around my site or drop me a message from one of my social medias in the navigation bar above.

### Who Am I?

I'm an engineer &amp; computer scientist who enjoys finding simplicity in the complex world we live in. I have a lot of passion for learning new things and love to equally distribute my knowledge to others.
Currently, I am a senior software engineer at Nordstrom. I've worked on a vast array of systems at companies like Intel, IBM, Allstate Insurance Labs, SimpleWan, ExxonMobil, Connexta &amp; presently Nordstrom.

<br/>

I studied and graduated with my bachelors and masters degree in computer science from Arizona State University and have a dream of one day continuing back into academia to complete my Ph.D.

<br/>

Outside of work, I enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction works of writing, long distance running, climbing, tennis &amp; skiing. I love the outdoors and currently reside in Phoenix, Arizona with my beautiful girlfriend Maddie and our little cat Tuffie (see logo).
