## ðŸ‘‹ Hey There!

Hey, thanks for checking out my blog. My name is Ryan Schachte and I created this blog to help teach others things that I've learned in my journey through engineering.
Feel free to browse around my site or drop me a message from one of my social medias in the navigation bar above.

### Who Am I?

I'm an engineer who loves to learn and also loves to teach and mentor. I'm an avid reader of both fiction and non-fiction works of writing and designed this site to share my knowledge with others.
Currently, I am a senior software engineer at Nordstrom. I've met many incredible people here and have had the opportunity to work on large-scale distributed systems, graph databases, data engineering, backend and frontend during my time there.
